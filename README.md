Social Action Network
The aim of this project is to build a social action network. 
A network putting together non for profit organizations and volunteers to make things happen and to give young people real life experience with projects with real impact.
The idea is to go from talk social networks to action social networks
If you are interested to change the world with this idea, please contact me on mlakhdissi@gmail.com
